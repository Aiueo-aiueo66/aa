Line chart showing historical global carbon dioxide emissions from 1850 to 2025 (projection) with three series: total emissions, fossil fuel and industry emissions, and land-use change emissions. Key insight: projected total emissions are about 43 billion tonnes in 2025, with no change from 2024; fossil emissions are about 38.9 billion tonnes, a 1 percent increase; land-use change emissions are about 4.1 billion tonnes, an 11 percent decrease, meaning the decline in land-use emissions offset the small rise in fossil emissions. Trends: all series rise slowly until the mid-20th century, then fossil and total emissions increase steeply from around 1950 to the present while land-use emissions fluctuate and decline in recent years. Axes: x-axis 1850 to 2025 (projection); y-axis labeled from 0 to 40 billion tonnes with ticks at 10 billion t increments.
